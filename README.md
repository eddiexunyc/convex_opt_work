# DATA 609 - Mathematical Modeling Techniques for Data Analytics

Collections of DATA 609 Assignments

This course will cover optimization theory through its practical applications to statistics and machine learning. 

The first half of the course will cover convex optimization (including least squares and linear programming as special cases), and the second half will cover methods for non-convex problems, primarily stochastic gradient descent and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Methods. 

Applications will include large-scale linear and logistic regression, regularization, maximum likelihood methods, support vector machines, neural networks, Bayesian statistics, and optimization problems arising in an operations research or other business context.
